  The data-driven story idea that our group came up with is to examine the impact of online activism on corporate social responsibility practices. As more individuals and organizations turn to online activism to advocate for social and environmental causes, it's worth exploring whether this digital movement is having a significant impact on corporate social responsibility practices. 
  
  To answer this question, we can analyze data on the CSR practices of companies that have been targeted by online campaigns and compare them to those that have not. We can also examine the extent to which online activism has influenced the public perception of CSR and how this affects consumer behavior.
This story is interesting and compelling because it delves into the potential power of online activism to shape corporate behavior and promote social change. It also highlights the potential pitfalls of relying solely on online activism, as companies may engage in "greenwashing" or other forms of surface-level CSR practices to appease activists without making real changes.

  To start, we can examine the CSR practices of companies that have been targeted by online campaigns. For example, we can look at the actions taken by companies that have been called out for environmental damage, labor abuses, or discriminatory practices. Did they make meaningful changes in response to online activism, or did they simply issue a public statement and continue with business as usual?
  
  Comparing the CSR practices of these companies to those that have not been targeted by online campaigns can provide insights into the impact of online activism on corporate behavior. Additionally, we can analyze the content and reach of these online campaigns to determine whether specific tactics or strategies are more effective in promoting CSR practices.
  
  Another important aspect to consider is the relationship between online activism, public perception of CSR, and consumer behavior. If online activism raises awareness of a company's poor CSR practices, does this lead to a decrease in sales or a loss of market share? Conversely, if online activism highlights a company's positive CSR practices, does this lead to an increase in consumer loyalty or preference? These are just some of the questions that are raised from this topic. 
  
By analyzing data on consumer behavior and public perception of CSR, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of online activism on corporate social responsibility practices. However, it's important to acknowledge the potential pitfalls of online activism, including the risk of companies engaging in surface-level or "token" CSR practices to appease activists without making real changes. This is definitely a common practice so itâ€™s essential to distinguish the difference.

This story has important implications for both activists and companies. Activists can use this data to strategize and develop more effective online campaigns, while companies can use it to evaluate their own CSR practices and make meaningful changes that benefit both society and their bottom line. Overall, understanding the power and pitfalls of online activism is crucial for creating a more just and sustainable future.
